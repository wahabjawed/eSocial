 <p class="lead question" >Q: How do I get started?</p>
      
        <p class="lead">A: Its Simple. Go to the order form (to the right) and fill out your username. Then click the "Buy Now" button and it will take you to a secure purchase area on paypal. Look for a receipt in your email and wait for 24-72 hours for your delivered followers, views, or downloads to arrive. We will keep you updated with emails along the way of the process and will let you know when your finished.</p>
 <p class="lead question">Q: Do you need my password or any login area?</p>
 
 <p class="lead">A: No. We will never need personal access to your page. All we need is your username or url to market to and send your thousands of followers, views, or downloads to</p>

 <p class="lead">A: Delivery of your order take between 24 â€“ 72 hours.</p>
 <p class="lead question">Q: Are these follower, downloads, views, hit & likes are real people?</p>
 
 <p class="lead">A: Our strategic ways is to promote your link / page to real people, although the traffic you are getting are realistic profiles to help with the process. Most of the companies that we have done this for use it as a PR support behind their marketing. Often times real people would rather follow someone with 15,000 follower rather then 15.</p>
 <p class="lead question">Q: You gave me more Twitter Followers then what I ordered, why?</p>
 
 <p class="lead">A: On a daily people lose followers due to the security of the social media sites. This is out of our control. Since this is a regularity, our suppliers give you a bit extra case you lose some. Unforntunately, we can no guarantee you any amount of followers, but can inform you that you will keep around 90% of the followers you buy.</p>
 <p class="lead question">Q: What is your money back guarantee?</p>
 
 <p class="lead">A: Being that we are reseller program, our money back and service guarantee is upon the purchase of the order. After the delivery is in processing (we will notify you via email), we can not reverse the order (followers, views, downloads) nor the charges for any purchase. </p>
